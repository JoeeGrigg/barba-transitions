# Deprecation Notice

This project is now deprecated.

Recently Barba v2 was released which has all of the features I added to v1, plus many more, and is maintained.

This project will no longer (not that I had been anyway) be maintained.

Barba can be found [here](https://github.com/barbajs/barba)

Barba Transitions
=================

This is an extension to [Barba](http://barbajs.org/).

It adds a custom transition which makes it really easy to make elements transition
on and off the page.

# Dependencies

* Barba

# Installation

You should install this package via NPM.

```
npm install barba-transitions
```

# Getting started

Initialise Barba as you normally would and the transitions will automatically kick in.

Then, define your css transitions in your stylesheet and pass that name as the value of
the ```data-transition``` attribute on each element that you wish to animate.

## Example

### HTML

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Index</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Home</h1>
  </header>
  <div id="barba-wrapper">
    <div class="barba-container">
      <section class="all-posts" data-transition="fadeIn">
        This is the main page content
      </section>
    </div>
  </div>

  <script src="barba.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <script src="barba.transitions.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <script src="main.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS

```
@keyframes fadeIn {
  0% {opacity: 0;}
  100% {opacity: 1;}
}
```

### JS

```
window.onload = function() {
  Barba.Pjax.start();
}
```

# Setting a custom transition time

To change the transition length it couldn't be simpler.

Define ```Barba.transitionLength``` in miliseconds in your JS, after Barba
is initialised and all transitions will use the newly defined time.

## Example

```
Barba.transitionLength = 1000;
```

This would set the transition length to be 1 second.
